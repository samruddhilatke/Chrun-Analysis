# Chrun-Analysis
python analysis

Objective: The analysis primarily investigates factors influencing customer churn,
particularly focusing on payment methods and contract types.

● Key Insights:
○ Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts show a higher tendency
to churn compared to those on yearly or bi-annual contracts. This suggests that
long-term contracts may improve customer retention.
○ Payment Methods: A significant proportion of customers using electronic checks
are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods (credit
cards, bank transfers, etc.). This could be due to convenience or trust issues
associated with electronic check payments.

● Churn Rate by Tenure:
○ Customers with shorter tenure (less than one year) are more likely to churn,
indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.

● Visualizations:
○ The visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, highlight the disparity in
churn rates by different contract types and payment methods. They also show
trends over customer tenure, supporting the need for personalized retention
strategies.

Visualizations & Data Insights:
● Bar Charts and Line Graphs:
○ The visual representation of churn by payment method clearly shows that
customers using electronic checks churn almost three times as much as those
using more traditional or secure methods like credit cards.

○ Customer tenure vs. churn rate visualizations reveal a clear declining trend in
churn as customers' tenure increases, underscoring the need for early-stage
customer loyalty programs.

● Percentage Distribution of Churn Across Factors:
○ Payment Methods: 45% churn for electronic check users, 15% for credit card
users.

 Contract Types: 42% churn for month-to-month contracts, 11% for yearly
contracts, 3% for two-year contracts.
○ Tenure: 50% churn in the first year, dropping to 15% after three years.
